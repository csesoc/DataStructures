## Why Structs.sh Exists

Structs.sh is a project that aims to be a comprehensive educational resource for data structures and algorithms, developed by passionate computer science and engineering students at UNSW. Structs.sh was inspired by a previous project, <a href="https://github.com/Tymotex/Tactile-DS">Tactile-DS</a>, an earlier project developed in 2020 as a tutoring tool and reference implementation for students to use in <a href="https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2022/COMP2521/?year=2022">COMP2521</a>.

Structs.sh exists to help bridge the gap between a student's high-level understanding of computer science concepts and how real code would accomplish a certain task. The project was started by students who felt there was a lack in tools/resources that focus on helping people develop a proper visual intuition for algorithmic thinking.
