/**
 * DIJKSTRA: dijkstra <vertex>
 * 
 * Dijkstra's algorithm for determining the single source spanning tree
 * of the input graph from the starting vertex
 * 
 * High-level steps:
 *   1. Look at every neighbour of the vertices we currently have in included
 *   2. Find the neighbour vertex with the lowest cost to get to and 
 *      include it in our set of vertices
 *   3. Look at all the unincluded neighbours of the new vertex, and
 *      update the dist array if we've found a BETTER path to those neighbours
 *   4. Repeat 1-3 until all vertices have been included in included
