    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'What is a graph in computer science?',
      options: [
        'A visual representation of quantitative data',
        'A collection of vertices connected by edges',
        'A method for sorting data',
        'A type of function in mathematics',
      ],
      answerIndex: 1,
      answerExplanation: 'In computer science, a graph is a collection of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges.',
    },
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'Which of the following is true for a directed graph?',
      options: [
        'All edges are bidirectional',
        'Edges have no direction',
        'Edges are directed from one vertex to another',
        'Vertices are not connected by edges',
      ],
      answerIndex: 2,
      answerExplanation: 'In a directed graph, edges have a direction, going from one vertex to another.',

    {
      type: 'short-answer',
      text: 'In a complete graph with N vertices, how many edges are there?',
      shortAnswer: 'N*(N-1)/2',
      answerExplanation: 'In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge, leading to N*(N-1)/2 edges.',
