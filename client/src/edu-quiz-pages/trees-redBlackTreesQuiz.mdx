Test your knowledge of Red-Black Trees with this quiz!

<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'What property of a Red-Black Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced?',
      options: [
        'The number of children of each node is equal',
        'Every path from root to leaves has the same number of black nodes',
        'Each node has either red or black color',
        'The root node is always black',
      ],
      answerIndex: 1,
      answerExplanation: 'In a Red-Black Tree, every path from the root to the leaves has the same number of black nodes, which ensures the tree remains approximately balanced.',
    },
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'In a Red-Black Tree, what is the maximum number of rotations needed to fix the tree after an insertion?',
      options: [
        '1',
        '2',
        '3',
        '4',
      ],
      answerIndex: 1,
      answerExplanation: 'After insertion in a Red-Black Tree, at most 2 rotations are needed to fix the tree.',
    },
    {
      type: 'short-answer',
      text: 'What is the maximum height of a Red-Black Tree with n nodes?',
      shortAnswer: '2log(n+1)',
      answerExplanation: 'The maximum height of a Red-Black Tree with n nodes is 2log(n+1).',
