# Dynamic Arrays Quiz

Test your knowledge of dynamic arrays with this 3-question quiz!

<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'What differentiates a dynamic array from a static array?',
      options: [
        'Dynamic arrays can store data of different types',
        'Dynamic arrays have fixed size at compile time',
        'Dynamic arrays can change size during runtime',
        'Dynamic arrays are faster than static arrays'
      ],
      answerIndex: 2,
      answerExplanation: 'Dynamic arrays can change their size during runtime, unlike static arrays that have a fixed size determined at compile time.',
    },
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'What happens when a dynamic array reaches its capacity and a new element is added?',
      options: [
        'The array is deleted',
        'The array size remains the same',
        'A new, larger array is created, and elements are copied to it',
        'An error is thrown'
      ],
      answerIndex: 2,
      answerExplanation: 'When a dynamic array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, a new, larger array is created and all elements are copied to this new array.',
    },
    {
      type: 'short-answer',
      text: 'In big O notation, what is the amortized time complexity of adding an element to a dynamic array?',
      shortAnswer: 'O(1)',
      answerExplanation: 'The amortized time complexity of adding an element to a dynamic array is O(1), meaning it is constant on average.',
