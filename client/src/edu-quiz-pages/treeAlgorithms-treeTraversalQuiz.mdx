# Tree Traversal Quiz

Test your knowledge of tree traversal with this quiz!

<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'Which of the following is not a tree traversal method?',
      options: [
        'In-order',
        'Pre-order',
        'Post-order',
        'Cross-order'
      ],
      answerIndex: 3,
      answerExplanation: 'Cross-order is not a recognized tree traversal method. The common traversal methods are In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order.',
    },
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      text: 'In a binary tree, what does an in-order traversal first visit?',
      options: [
        'The root node',
        'The leftmost child node',
        'The rightmost child node',
        'The parent node'
      ],
      answerIndex: 1,
      answerExplanation: 'In in-order traversal, the leftmost child node is visited first, followed by its parent node, and then the right child.',
    },
    {
      type: 'short-answer',
      text: 'What is the depth of the root node in a tree?',
      shortAnswer: '0',
      answerExplanation: 'The depth of the root node in a tree is always 0.',
