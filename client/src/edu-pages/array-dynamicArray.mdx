# Dynamic Array

## Basic Introduction
A **dynamic array** is an array with a big improvement: automatic resizing.

One limitation of arrays is that they're fixed size, meaning you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time.

A dynamic array expands as you add more elements. So you don't need to determine the size ahead of time.

**Strengths**:
- **Fast lookups.** Just like arrays, retrieving the element at a given index takes O(1) time.
- **Variable size.** You can add as many items as you want, and the dynamic array will expand to hold them.
- **Cache-friendly.** Just like arrays, dynamic arrays place items right next to each other in memory, making efficient use of caches.

## Size vs. Capacity

When you allocate a dynamic array, your dynamic array implementation makes an underlying fixed-size array. 
The starting size depends on the implementationâ€”let's say our implementation uses 10 indices. 
Now say we append 4 items to our dynamic array. 
At this point, our dynamic array has a length of 4. 
But the underlying array has a length of 10.
