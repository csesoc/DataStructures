# Arrays🐶

## What is an Array? 📚

An **array** is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
Each element in the array is identified by its index, which is an integer value starting from zero.
It is one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other data strucutres.

## Basic terminologies of array 🔧
- **Array Index**: the numeric value that represents the position or location of an element within an array.
- **Array Element**: the individual value or data item stored within an array.
- **Array Length**: the number of elements contained within an array.

## Types of arrays: 😉
- **One-dimensional array (1-D array)**: elements in the array are organized in a single row or line.
- **Two-dimensional array (2-D array)**: 
- **Multi-dimensional array**:

## Advantages of using arrays 🎉
- **Organized Data**: Arrays provide a structured way to organize and store multiple values of the same data type.
- **Random Access**: Arrays enable direct access to individual elements using their indices.
- **Efficiency**: Arrays provide constant-time access to elements based on their indices.
- **Iteration**: Arrays can be easily traversed using loops, allowing you to iterate over the elements sequentially. 
- **Memory Efficiency**: Arrays have a fixed memory footprint, making them memory-efficient.
- **Simplicity**: Arrays have a straightforward and intuitive syntax, making them easy to understand and implement.

## Implementation of basic array in C ✍️

<CodeBlock>
{`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   printf("%d", arr[2]); // Output: 3
   return 0;
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Code explaination 😎
- `int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`: This line declares and initializes an integer array named `arr` within a length of 5. It is initialized with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- `printf("%d", arr[2]);`: This line uses the `printf()` function to print the value at index 2 of the `arr` array. In C, arrays are zero-based, so the index 2 refers to the third element of the array. Therefore, it will print the value 3.
