# Understanding Trees in Data Structures 🌳

## What is a Tree? 🤔

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Unlike arrays, which are linear, trees are non-linear and mirror a real-world hierarchy. Each tree has a **root node** at the top, with child nodes branching out below.

## Basic Terminologies of Trees 🌲
- **Root**: The topmost node in a tree.
- **Child**: A node directly connected to another node moving downwards.
- **Parent**: The converse notion of a child.
- **Siblings**: Nodes sharing the same parent.
- **Leaf**: A node without children.
- **Depth**: The distance from the root to the node.
- **Height**: The distance from a node to the deepest leaf.

## Types of Trees: 🌴
- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent, and the right child only nodes with values greater.
- **AVL Tree**: A balanced BST where the height of the left and right subtrees can differ by at most one.
- **N-ary Tree**: Each node can have more than two children.

## Advantages of Trees 🎈
- **Reflects Structural Relationships**: Useful in representing hierarchies.
- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a tree can grow or shrink dynamically.
- **Efficient Search and Sort**: BSTs offer efficient search and sort operations.
- **Flexibility**: More flexible than arrays and linked lists.

## Implementation of a Basic Binary Tree in C++ ✍️

<CodeBlock>
{`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left, *right;
    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};

int main() {
    Node *root = new Node(1);
    root->left = new Node(2);
    root->right = new Node(3);
    // Tree:  1
    //       / \\
    //      2   3
    return 0;
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Code Explanation 😃
- `Node *root = new Node(1);`: This line creates the root node of the tree with data 1.
- `root->left = new Node(2);`: This line attaches a new node with data 2 as the left child of the root.
- `root->right = new Node(3);`: Similarly, a right child with data 3 is attached to the root.

## Conclusion 🎓
Trees are a fundamental data structure useful in various applications like file systems, databases, and more. They provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations, making them indispensable in computer science.
