# 2D Array 🥳

Welcome to our guide on 2D Arrays in C!

Here you will learn how to use and understand seamlessly the very scary topic that is 2D arrays!

To break it down nice and easy, we will be covering 6 operations:
- **Creating** a 2D Array 🔧
- **Initialising** a 2D Array 📚
- **Accessing** elements in a 2D Array 🔍
- **Editing** elements in a 2D Array ✏️
- **Iterating** through a 2D Array 🔁

# Creating a 2D Array

## Preface 🐶

A 2D array is often referred to as an array of arrays, or a matrix!
This is because it consist of rows and columns, and thus takes the shape of a matrix!

## Getting Started 🎉

To create a 2D array in C, you will need to declare it using the following syntax:

<CodeBlock>
  {`<datatype> <arrayname> [row_size][col_size];`}
</CodeBlock>

Where:
- `<datatype>` is the datatype of the array (i.e. `int`, `char`, `bool`, etc...)
- `<arrayname>` is the name of the array (i.e. `my_array`)
- `row_size` is the number of rows in the array
- `col_size` is the number of columns in the array

For example, to create a 2D array of integers with 2 rows and 4 columns, you would use the following declaration:

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[2][4];`}
</CodeBlock>

# Initailising a 2D Array 📚

## Preface 🐶

Whats the fun in creating a 2D array if we can't store stuff in it? 😛 
Here we will learn how to create a 2D array with values already present in it. 
This operation is called **initialisation**.

## Getting Started 🎉

So before we learnt we could create an array with 2 rows and 4 columns by the following:

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[2][4];`}
</CodeBlock>

But lets say that we want to initialise some values to it, specifically:
- The integers `1,2,3,4`, in the first row
- The integers `5,6,7,8`, in the second row

To do that we would use the following initialisation:

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[2][4] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4}, // First row
  {5, 6, 7, 8} // Second row
};`}
</CodeBlock>

If we were to add another row, it could look something like this!

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[3][4] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4}, // First row
  {5, 6, 7, 8}, // Second row
  {9, 10, 11, 12} // Third row
};`}
</CodeBlock>

If we were to add another column, it could look something like this!

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[2][5] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, // First row
  {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, // Second row
};`}
</CodeBlock>

# Accessing elements in a 2D Array 📚

## Preface 🐶

Whats the fun in storing elements in a 2D array if we can't access the elements? 😛 
Here we will learn how to access the elements in a 2D array.

## Getting Started 🎉

To access an element in a 2D array you need two things!
- The **row** index
- The **column** index

With those two things we can accesss any element!
- Remember that indexes start at `0`, so the **first row** and **first columns** will have indexes of `0`.

## Writing the code ✍️

So luckily writing the code to access an element is very similar to our thought process above - we need the row and column indexes of the element we want to access!

For example, if I wanted to access the element in the first row and second column, I would do the following:

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_num = my_array[0][1];`}
</CodeBlock>

This creates an integer variable called `my_num`, and assigns it the value of whatever element is stored at `my_array[0][1]`.

# Editing elements in a 2D Array ✏️

## Preface 🐶

So we've learnt how to access elements in an array, but whats also cool is that we can change those elements too!

## Getting Started 🎉

To edit an element in a 2D array you need **two** things!
- The **row** index
- The **column** index

Say we have the following array:

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[2][4] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4}, // First row
  {5, 6, 7, 8} // Second row
};`}
</CodeBlock>

We know that to access element `2`, we can do the following:

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_num = my_array[0][1];`}
</CodeBlock>

Luckily, editing it is very similar!

Let say we want to change the element at `[0][1]` to be 42, we can do the following:

<CodeBlock>
  {`my_array[0][1] = 42;`}
</CodeBlock>

# Iterating through a 2D Array 🔁

## Preface 🐶

Whats the point of storing stuff in an array if we can access them all? Here we will learn how to iterate through a 2D array.

## Getting Started 🎉

To iterate through a 2D array you need:
- A variable representing the **row** index
- A variable representing the **column** index
- A **nested for-loop**!

So again, let's say we have the following array,

<CodeBlock>
  {`int my_array[2][4] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4}, // First row
  {5, 6, 7, 8} // Second row
};`}
</CodeBlock>

How would we iterate through the elements and print them out?

Well let's do it!

<CodeBlock>
  {`int row, col;
for (row = 0; row < 2; row++) {
    for (col = 0; col < 4; col++) {
        printf("%d ", myArray[row][col]);
    }
    printf("\\n");
}`}
</CodeBlock>

- The first loop runs through each row of the array, starting with row 0
- Then for that specific row, the second for loop, runs through every column
- Then for each column, we just print out the element!

The result will be:

<CodeBlock>
  {`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`}
</CodeBlock>
