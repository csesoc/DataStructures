# Linked Lists🚀

## What is a Linked List? 🌐

A **linked list** is a dynamic data structure used to store a collection of elements, called **nodes**. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each node contains the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Basic Terminologies of Linked List 🔍
- **Node**: The fundamental part of a linked list. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
- **Head**: The first node in a linked list.
- **Tail**: The last node in a linked list, usually pointing to `null`.
- **Pointer**: A reference to another node.

## Types of Linked Lists: 🤔
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node and the last node points to `null`.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two pointers, one to the next node and another to the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List**: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the head.

## Advantages of Using Linked Lists 🌟
- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a linked list can grow or shrink during runtime.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing elements doesn’t require shifting the elements.
- **Memory Efficient**: No need to define the size ahead of time.

## Implementation of a Basic Linked List in C++ ✍️

<CodeBlock>
{`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
   int data;
   Node* next;
};

void printList(Node* n) {
   while (n != NULL) {
      cout << n->data << " ";
      n = n->next;
   }
}

int main() {
   Node* head = NULL;
   Node* second = NULL;
   Node* third = NULL;

   head = new Node();
   second = new Node();
   third = new Node();

   head->data = 1; 
   head->next = second; 
   second->data = 2; 
   second->next = third;
   third->data = 3; 
   third->next = NULL;

   printList(head);

   return 0;
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Code Explanation 🧠
- **Node Structure**: Defines a `Node` with `data` and a `next` pointer.
- `head = new Node();`: Initializes the head of the list.
- `head->data = 1;`: Assigns data to the head node.
- `head->next = second;`: Links the head node to the second node.
- The `printList` function traverses the list and prints each node's data.
