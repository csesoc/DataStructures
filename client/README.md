### Running the front-end without Docker

1. `cd` into the `client` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install node modules
3. Run `npm start` to start the server. The frontend should be accessible at `localhost:3000`

# Running Docker image

To run the app with Docker, (both the client and server simultaneously) see the instructs in the [README.md](/README.md) in the project root directory.
